# GDSL-Sketchy_Shader
#### Godot Shading Language (GLSL-like) porting of the Sketchy Shader (originally written in Open Shading Language)

GDSL (Godot Shading Language) is similar to GLSL ES 3.0. Most datatypes and functions are supported.
Like the OSL-counterpart, it takes an image as input mask (in this case the one called Poisson_Noise.png).
It is possible to outline the object by applying the *Outline Material* in the Next Pass section of the principle material.
